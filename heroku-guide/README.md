## Heroku Deployment Guide

* Heroku is a cloud application platform. This means that we can run our scripts on Heroku's servers! Here are the steps to do get our apps running on Heroku.

* Important: before deploying your code to a cloud server, verify that it runs without error locally (i.e. be able to run it from your console or in Jupyter Notebook without errors).

* Push your code to Github. Include both the `Procfile` and `requirements.txt` files in the directory. 

* Open your `Procfile` with a text editor, and replace `ChatterBot.py` with the name of your Python script.

* Your `requirements.txt` should list the required modules, and their versions. Here, we require only the `tweepy` module, version `3.5.0`. You can run `conda list` from your console to display all the modules you have installed, as well as their version numbers.

* Next, go to [heroku.com](heroku.com) and create an account.

* After registering, click on `New`, then on `Create new app`. You will create a new `app` for each program.
